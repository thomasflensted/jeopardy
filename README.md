## Jeopardy

This is a text-based Jeopardy game I made to practice my database skills. The user chooses the difficulty and the number of questions. All questions are stored in a SQL database and queried via Python with its SQLite3 library. I created the database from a tsv file (also included in this repo) I found online.
